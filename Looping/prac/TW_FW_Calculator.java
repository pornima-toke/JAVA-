/* Q32. An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:
• 1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
• 2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.
Example :
Input : • 200 -> Value of V
• 540 -> Value of W
Output : • TW =130   FW=70
Explanation: 130+70 = 200 vehicles (70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels */ 

import java.util.*;
public class TW_FW_Calculator {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the number");
		
        int V = sc.nextInt();  // Total vehicles
        int W = sc.nextInt();  // Total wheels

        if (W >= 2 * V && W <= 4 * V && W % 2 == 0) {
            int FW = (W - 2 * V) / 2;
            int TW = V - FW;

            System.out.println("TW = " + TW);
            System.out.println("FW = " + FW);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid input");
        }
    }
}
